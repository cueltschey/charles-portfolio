                My mother told me to make sure I loved my career... So I started a career in software.<br></br>
                Since then I've grown to love computers and the power they have to change the world. 
                Now I have a wide variety of skills under my belt. From WPF aplications to 
                Chrome extensions to mobile apps, I've put my skills to use solving problems and increasing productivity.
